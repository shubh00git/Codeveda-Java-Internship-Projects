# Codveda Java Development Internship - Projects

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my Java Development Internship at **Codveda**. The internship provided a practical, hands-on learning experience, focusing on strengthening core Java programming skills through a series of progressively challenging tasks. The work spans from fundamental programming concepts to advanced data structures and algorithms.

## üöÄ Projects Overview

I successfully completed three projects, each targeting a different skill level and set of computer science principles.

### 1. Level 1: Number Guessing Game
* **Description**: A simple and interactive console-based game where the program generates a random number, and the user must guess it within a limited number of attempts.
* **Key Concepts**: This project builds a strong foundation in Java fundamentals, including handling user input (`Scanner`), generating random numbers (`Random` class), implementing program loops, and using conditional logic to provide feedback.
* **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    cd Level1-NumberGuessingGame
    javac GuessTheNumber.java
    java GuessTheNumber
    ```

### 2. Level 2: Employee Management System
* **Description**: A console application that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by managing employee records. The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for employee data.
* **Key Concepts**: This project focuses on designing classes (`Employee`), encapsulation, and managing collections of objects using an `ArrayList`. It provides practical experience in building a structured, data-centric application.
* **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    cd Level2-EmployeeManagementSystem
    javac *.java
    java Main
    ```

### 3. Level 3: Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation
* **Description**: An advanced project focused on implementing a non-linear data structure from scratch. This involved creating a Binary Search Tree with full functionality for insertion, search, deletion, and various traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).
* **Key Concepts**: This task demonstrates a deep understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It required implementing recursive algorithms for traversal and manipulation, managing node-based data structures, and understanding the logic that underpins efficient data retrieval.
* **How to Run**:
    ```bash
    cd Level3-BinarySearchTree
    javac *.java
    java Main
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

* **Core Java**: Strong understanding of syntax, control flow, and core libraries.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Class design, encapsulation, and creating modular code.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Implementation and practical application of `ArrayList` and Binary Search Trees.
* **Recursion**: Applied recursive thinking for solving complex problems like BST traversal and deletion.
* **Error Handling**: Basic exception handling and input validation.
* **Version Control**: Used Git and GitHub for project management and versioning.
